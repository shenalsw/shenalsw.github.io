				<p>
				Ceylon Silver Tips, commonly known as White Tea, is a very rare Ceylon tea, entirely handmade and extremely limited in production just a few hundred kilos per year. White is the color of innocence, purity and goodness. White tea is made from the tender bud of a special variety of the tea plant, Camellia Sinensis, which is handpicked before the sun rises. Account of its rarity, it is a very exclusive tea that is available only in selected places. Yet it is an experience that must be savored at least once in a lifetime.<br><br><br>
				White tea is the least processed of the three teas. Because of this, it retains a high number of antioxidants. White tea is a great source of fluoride, catechins and tannins. Several studies have shown that these compounds can help fight bacteria that cause plaque on teeth. White tea and its compounds may protect the skin from damage linked to aging. This includes external damage from the sun’s UV rays and internal damage from cellular components that may harm the skin’s fiber network.
